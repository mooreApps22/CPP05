Basic Facts From Subject:

Exception classes don't have to be OCF

There is some initial fluff that doesn't mean anything

	Bureaucrat class
		name		 	- const std::string
		grade			- a 1 to 150 int

	Any instantiation of a Bureaucrat with an invalid grade must throw an exception.

		Bureaucrat::GradeTooHighException (over 150)
		Bureaucrat::GradeTooLowException (under 1)

	You will provide getters:
		
			std::string	getName(void) const
			void	setName(std::string)

	 incrementGrade() // <--lowers grade 3 to grade 2
	 decrementGrade() // <--raises grade 2 to grade 3


	 Thrown exceptions must be catchable using try/catch blocks:

	 Overload operater<<  to print some stament like: _name << ", bureaucrat grade " << _grade << std::endl;
