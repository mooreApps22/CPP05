Basic Facts From Subject:

	Form Class
		
		private:
			constant name
			boolean for if Form is signed (at construction, it's not)
			constant grade (a requirement to sign it)
			constant grade required ot execute it 
	
		Forms grades follow the same rules as Bureaucrat grades
			Form::GradeTooHighException // under 1
			Form::GradeLowHighException // over 150

		Getters:
			getName(void)
			gradeRequirement(void)
			executionRequirement(void)
			hasBeenSigned(void)

		Operator Overload:
			<< must print all the forms informations

		Utils:
			Form::beSigned(Bureaucrat& buddy) // changes the form status to signed if buddy's grade is high enough (=<)
				throw exception if out of range 

			Bureaucrat::signForm(Form& paper, std::string reason) // 
				- outputs <bureaucratName> signed <formName>
				- OR <bureaucratName> couldn't sign <formName> because <reason>
